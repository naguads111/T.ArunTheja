How do call output of one module in another module ?
Lets say have created lot of resources using terraform and is there way to delete one of the resource through terraform ?

Removing the bad resource from state and re-import the resource ?
How do import manually created resources into terraform ?
What are the Features in Terraform ?
What is State file & Where its store ?
What happened if State file will be delete OR lost ?
Terraform forget all the resources has created it exists upto manual deletion, So running terraform command it assumes that these are all new resources then its try to recreate a new resource again.
What is Lifecycle & What are they ?
How do lock a state file ? 
without DynamoDB, If two OR more terraform developers are modifying the same code and running terraform command at a time through different CLI will be corrupted.
To prevent this need to enable DynamoDB Locking after enabling lock only one person is allowed to perform the operation running terraform command and remaining terraform developers will hold upto current process finishes.
Don't let developer2 to perform running terraform command until developer1 finishes.
If someone make changes to VPC directly in AWS console then what happened and how terraform behaves ? 
It always try to match what We describe in the code.
Suppose i remove one tag for VPC through AWS console and remaining 2 tags will be there, in desired code .tf VPC resource has 3 tags through CLI running terraform command like apply can see those change very clear and its add one more tag to that VPC.
